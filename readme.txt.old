SensePost JBaah is a generic HTTP Fuzz tool.

JBaah can be started as follows:

java -jar JBaah.jar

In cases where really large fuzz sets are used, you may have to increase the 
memory allocated to the Java Virtual Machine.

This can be done by executing JBaah as follows:

java -Xms1024M -Xmx1024M -XX:PermSize=256M -XX:MaxPermSize=256M -jar JBaah.jar
